## Introduction

This notebook focuses on the analysis and prediction of crop yields in Gujarat using machine learning techniques. The project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting crop production and to develop models that can help in making informed agricultural decisions.

## Data Import and Preprocessing

### Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Steps

1. **Loading the Dataset**: Import the dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Check and handle any missing values in the dataset.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like Label Encoding.
4. **Feature Selection**: Use statistical tests like chi-square and correlation heatmaps to select important features.
5. **Data Scaling**: Normalize the data using Standard Scaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Summary Statistics**: Generate basic statistics to understand the dataset.
2. **Visualization**: Create plots to visualize trends and patterns in crop production.
   - Trends in agricultural imports and exports
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Feature importance charts

## Machine Learning Models

### Algorithms Used

1. **Linear Regression**: Basic regression technique to find a linear relationship between features and target.
2. **Decision Tree Regression**: A tree-based model to capture non-linear relationships.
3. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Uses hyperplanes to predict real values.
4. **AdaBoost Regression**: An ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners.
5. **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble of decision trees for better prediction accuracy.

### Model Evaluation Metrics

- **R² Score**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Cross-validation Score**

## Results

The performance of different models is compared using the evaluation metrics. The Random Forest Regressor showed the best performance with the highest R² score and the lowest RMSE.

### Key Findings

- The feature 'Area' has a significant impact on crop production.
- Random Forest Regression provides better predictions compared to other models.
- Proper feature scaling and selection are crucial for model performance.

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates the potential of machine learning in agricultural predictions. By using various regression techniques, the study identifies key factors affecting crop yields and suggests that ensemble methods like Random Forest offer superior prediction capabilities.
